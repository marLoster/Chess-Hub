The goal of this project was to create a chess application that would allow to play with created chess bots. 
Included in this project are also working scripts that simulate games using two bots and send the game result to PostgreSQL database.
There are also scripts that populate data warehouse once a day with the results of games between bots.

There are various scripts for models in the AI directory however, there are still a lot of other ideas to try and there is certainly a place to improve.

The application uses its own chess engine written from scratch.
